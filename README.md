[![Build Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/53faaa6d2f4e2cc406c539f7/badge/master)](https://www.shippable.com/projects/53faaa6d2f4e2cc406c539f7)

This repo is used to set up the R package development environment for me on
Shippable. Because Shippable maintains the state of its Minions, the installed
packages will not be re-installed during the next build, which will save a lot
of time.
